** I ignore venv/ because the file size is too large **
 Create the Virtual Environment (enter vs code terminal this command ) = python -m venv venv

 3) After creating the environment, you need to activate it (enter vs code terminal this command ) = venv\Scripts\activate

 4)Then run the project  = streamlit run app.py 

 5) Definitely got an error because don't install the necessary pip packages (The error shows on the terminal pls download it)

  ex- pip install tensorflow
    pip install keras
    pip install mathplotlib

 I can't mention all the files here, when run program suggest which pkg needs to run
